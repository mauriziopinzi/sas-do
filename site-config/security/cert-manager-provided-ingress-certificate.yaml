## Example PatchTransformer to patch the secret used by nginx ingress objects
##
## In the following code, the locations that require user specified values are indicated by a capitalized and
## hyphenated name set off by curly braces and a space at each end. You should replace this token with the 
## actual value.
## Replace the curly braces, interior spaces, and the variable name.
## For instance, "{{ CERT-MANAGER-ISSUER-NAME }}"
## should be replaced with the name of the cert-manager issuer that will issue certificates used to make
## TLS connections to the SAS Viya applications, such as sas-viya-issuer.
## If you use the suggested example, the correct, final syntax would be:
## value: sas-viya-issuer
##
